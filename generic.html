									<h1>A bit about me</h1>

								</header>
								
								<p>I was born and raised in Israel. Following my high school graduation, I did a 3-year mandatory service at the Israeli Defense Force as part of the armored corps.  I was chosen by my brigade commander to be a tank commander and had the privilege to lead a team of 15 soldiers throughout training, operations, and challenging missions.</p>

								<p>On my last day of service, operation "Protective Edge" began, and I went back to my base, picked a team, and chose a tank to command and led my friends and soldiers into battle. Our opening position was far from ideal; we had no maps, and some of us were even unarmed. But I had a mission to complete and soldiers who looked up to me to lead them. Therefore, we went in with what we had, and we performed at our best. During the operation, my officer's tank broke down, and I took responsibility over the tank platoon and the surrounding units. I did what I do best – Effectively control and manage the situation, protect my comrades, and achieve our desired goals.</p>

								<p>A few years later, during a full lockdown in Tel Aviv, I decided to take on a new challenge. I left my comfortable life and position at KPMG and moved to the US. I taught myself Python and SQL and with the money I saved I bought a ticket and moved. When I landed in Atlanta, GA, I started looking for a job and got accepted to work as an Analyst in a small start-up called Panther Group. In my current position I acquired real-world experience in Python, SQL, Tableau, and using AWS. I get to deal with challenging projects without clear explanations minimum information and lots of room for decision making. </p>

								<p>On June of 2022 I decided to follow my heart and move to Fort Collins, CO to live with my partner. My goal is to work for a place that will utilize my skill set and my unique life story. But that’s not all I’m looking for; I am looking for a culture that challenges employees to be their best towards the job, and towards each other. During my military service, I learned that ultimately, people fight for two things - the mission, certainly, but more often for the brothers and sisters in arms beside them.</p>
