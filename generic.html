									<h1>A bit about me</h1>

								</header>
								
								<p>
									My journey from Israel to the United States has equipped me with a unique blend of technical expertise, leadership
									experience, and a deep passion for data analysis and business intelligence. My background aligns perfectly with this
									role's requirements, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.
									Born and raised in Israel, I served in the Israeli Defense Force as part of the 3-year mandatory service. Selected by my
									brigade commander, I became a tank commander, leading a team of 15 soldiers through rigorous training and challenging
									missions.
								</p>

								<p>
									On my last day of service, operation "Protective Edge" began, and I went back to my base, picked a team, and chose a
									tank to command and lead my friends and soldiers to battle. Our opening position was far from ideal; we had no maps, and
									some were even unarmed. But I had a mission to complete and soldiers who looked up to me to lead them. Therefore, we
									went in with what we had and performed at our best. My officer's tank broke down during the operation, and I took
									responsibility for the tank platoon and the surrounding units. I did what I did best – control and manage the situation,
									protect my soldiers, and achieve the wanted goals.<br>
									After my military service, I sought new challenges. During the COVID pandemic, while staying home on a lockdown in Tel
									Aviv, I left my position at KPMG, taught myself Python and SQL, and moved to the United States. Upon arriving in
									Atlanta, GA, I secured a role as an Analyst at Panther Group. In this start-up, I tackled projects with minimal
									information, honing my Python, SQL, and AWS skills.

								</p>

								<p>
									In 2023, I moved to Fort Collins, CO, to follow my love and be with my now-wife. I joined Best Self Aesthetics as a
									Data Analyst <strong>(and was later promoted to Data Scientist)</strong>, where I built the company's data infrastructure from the
									ground up. My role involves creating and managing a cloud-based database, developing Power BI dashboards and
									reports, and performing ad hoc data analysis. I thrive on the challenges of designing and implementing data
									solutions, and I am passionate about using data to drive business growth.
								</p>
								<p>
									My current role can be divided into three main segments:
								<ol>
									<li>Cloud Database Creation and Management</li>
									<li>Power BI Dashboard and Report Development</li>
									<li>Ad Hoc Data Analysis and Strategic Insights</li>
								</ol>
								</p>
								<p>
									While I excel in all three areas, my true passion lies in data analysis and applying machine learning and
									statistical methods to predict and test data. I leverage these insights to drive strategic decisions and enable
									various roles within the company to make informed changes.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>I am seeking an opportunity that will allow me to utilize the unique combination of my love for data, advanced skills,
									business acumen, and the ability to drive key business discussions with strong communication and leadership abilities.</strong>
									But that's not all I'm looking for; I am looking for a culture that challenges employees to be their best towards the
									job and each other. In my military service I learned that in the end of the day people will fight for two things – the
									mission and the people around them. I am eager to bring this mindset to a challenging and collaborative work
									environment.
